# Repository Changed

https://github.com/qkrtmdgns23/GameEngineArchitecture_GDH_Engine/tree/release_midterm_test

## Purpose
* **Study Memory Management in C++**
* **Study Rendering System with OpenGL**
* **Study Game Engine Architecture with developing my custom engine**
　  
　   
## Coding Style 
* Almost same with Google C++ Style  
[[Google Cpp Style Guide]](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
* My source code will get some errors with coding style because of my mistakes. But anyone tell me about that, I will fix it soon.
